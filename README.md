Run Main.py as such-
python Main.py --targetapp "APP NAME" --cols RESOLUTION

WARNING: if Main.py doesn't output anything, this is because you set the resolution too high

If you are unsure of the app name, run WhatisOpen.py
If a black screen is shown in test.png, change the last number on line 151 on Main.py to 0 or something else
